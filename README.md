- pip install mysql-connector-python


### LIBARIES
- Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides capabilities for creating and managing graphics, sound, and user input, making it an excellent choice for developing interactive applications and games.

- Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms. It provides a powerful array library and a collection of neural network models, making it suitable for building and training deep learning models.

- Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

- MySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems. It is widely used for managing and organizing structured data. In Python, you can interact with MySQL databases

### Step 4: Run the game

## Advantages of the project

- Skill Development: Playing a fighting game requires mastering various techniques, timing, and strategies, which can enhance players' reflexes, decision-making skills, and hand-eye coordination.

- Social Interaction: Two-player fighting games encourage social interaction and friendly competition among players, fostering camaraderie and social bonding.

- Variety of Moves and Characters: With a wide range of moves, combos, and characters to choose from, players have the opportunity to experiment and develop their own unique playstyles.

- AI Gameplay: The inclusion of AI opponents provides players with the option to enjoy the game even when friends are not available, offering challenging matches and opportunities for skill improvement in single-player mode.

## Disadvantages of the project

- Limited Combo Options: The game may have a limited number of combo moves, potentially reducing the depth of gameplay and variety of strategies available to players.

- Limited AI Complexity: The current AI implementation may only execute simple actions, lacking the depth and adaptability of human players. As a result, single-player matches against AI opponents may feel predictable and less engaging compared to playing against human opponents.
